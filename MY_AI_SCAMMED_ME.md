Turns out I thought I was being really clever setting up agents, skills, going back and forth with a plan
--until I got to day 5.

I only asked the agent to set up the files and directory structure for day 5, with
placeholders, but when it implemented day5.py, it included the full solution for both part 1 and 2. Mind
you, I had not even supplied the problem description to it at this point. It just saw it was an AoC 2025
repo, saw this was day5.py, saw the structure of previous files, and vomited the solutions from the
Internet. Meaning I wasn't really clever at all. I wonder whose code I've stolen up to day 5. Sorry for
that, it wasn't really me, honest. 

From day 6 onward, I'm just using LLM to answer questions, no more generative shit stealing from others 
and scamming me into thinking they were my own solutions.
